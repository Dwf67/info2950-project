Other characteristics like longitude and latitude were too specific for a general audience, as opposed to the general location characteristic. Square footage of the listing would be a beneficial characteristic to include, but after checking the null value, we found that 43768 of the listings do not contain this information, which is 98.7% of our total listings, so we decided to drop it. Finally, given our research question, we chose to include location, property type, and price for property characteristics, and use host response time, host response rate, and cancellation policy for the primary host characteristics. We also need to use review scores rating as our output variable. Furthermore, all other columns will be removed, as we deemed them irrelevant to our research question. "

Also, it is proven that people are more likely to leave a review if it's a negative experience.This means that the results are likely skewed where properties with lower ratings are more likely to have been in our sample since we removed the properties with no ratings.\n",

Similarly, we narrowed it down to location, property type, and price for the property attributes; however, many other things could be impacting the Airbnb listing which are not accounted for."
